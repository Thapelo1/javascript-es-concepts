ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this repo, I cover these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.


# Promises
In JavaScript, a promise is exactly what it sounds like: it is used to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task is completed, you either fulfill or fail to fulfill your promise. Promise is a constructor function, so to create one, use the new keyword. It takes as an argument a function with two parameters: resolve and reject. These are the methods used to determine the promise's outcome.

A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
