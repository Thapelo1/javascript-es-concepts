ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this repo, I cover these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.


# Scope
When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
